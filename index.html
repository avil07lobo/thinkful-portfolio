                <h2>About Avil</h2>
                <p>I am originally from Mumbai, India, and came to United States of America, in 2016 to pursue my Masters Degree in Engineering. Having complete my Masters Degree, I secured my first full time job here in the US, as an IT Engineer.</p>
                <p>I do enjoy working with IT, especially working with Server, Network Switches and a lot of complex equipment. But over the past year, working with these equipment has also made me think deeper about the software aspect that goes into these complex hardware, both backend and front end. And that curiosity, persuaded me to start my journey in pursing Software Development.</p>
                <p>I am so excited to be a student at Thinkful, and looking forward to see what this journey entails.</p>
                <p>If you are looking to hire a new passionate developer, for all your software needs, please feel free to reach out. I will be glad to be on a team, that I can add value to and at the same time learn a lot from!</p>
